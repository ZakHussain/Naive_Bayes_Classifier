# Naive_Bayes_Classifier
In This Jupyter Notebook, I build a Naive Bayes Classifier from scratch to handle a binary classification task. The .fit method builds a model from two directory paths. Here, there should be two directories. One for Ham labelled words, and another for Spam words. In my case, The Ham directory contained text files, where each file contained n lines. Each line contained a single word. The words were listed in alphabetical order throughout all the files. This format was also true for the spam data set. With a data set in order, the .fit() method builds the model, the tune_laplace_params() method allows for optimizing the classifier, and the .predict() runs predictions.
